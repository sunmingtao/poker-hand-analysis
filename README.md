# Mistakes 

- Do not bluff unless I know opponent will fold. Do not value bet the river unless I know my hand is the best. 
- I bet because checking would look weak. 
- When a player is uncapped, bluffing that player will not be profitable. 

# Advice

Use a random number to decide whether to call or fold when it comes to a close decision.
