# Mistakes 

- Do not bluff unless I know opponent will fold. Do not value bet the river unless I know my hand is the best. 
- I bet because checking would look weak. 
- When a player is uncapped, bluffing that player will not be profitable. 
- Just because I was ready to give up on the flop, doesn't mean I also need to give up on the turn unimproved. (Villain's check flop might mean he was ready to give up)
- Continue to play after a bad beat, then make bad calls. 

# Advice

Use a random number to decide whether to call or fold when it comes to a close decision.

BB vs SB, shall I take a stab when checked to even with little equity? e.g. Hero has A5s on T86 flop.
