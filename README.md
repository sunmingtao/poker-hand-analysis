# Mistakes 

- Do not bluff unless I know opponent will fold. Do not value bet the river unless I know my hand is the best. 
- I bet because checking would look weak. 
- When a player is uncapped, bluffing that player will not be profitable. 
- Just because I was ready to give up on the flop, doesn't mean I also need to give up on the turn unimproved. (Villain's check flop might mean he was ready to give up)

# Advice

Use a random number to decide whether to call or fold when it comes to a close decision.
