## Preflop

1. KQo at BTN/SB squeeze MP/CO open
2. KQo not 3bet BB vs SB
3. AJo/KQo at CO call or 4bet BTN's 3bet(They should all fold, even to a 3x 3bet, AQo/AQs/KQs/KJs/QJs call, TT/JJ/AKo 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs 4bet call)
4. 88/99 at SB squeeze MP/CO open (TT+ should squeeze)
5. TT/JJ cold 4bet MP open, BTN 3bet (TT should fold, JJ should call)
6. 89s, 55 call large 3bet (4x+ hero open)
7. AQo not cold 4bet BTN open, SB 3bet, (Should half pot cold 4bet) 
8. AQo call all in BB vs SB against 50BB short stacker
9. Use A5s-A9s, TJ+ to isolate limp fish (At least use AT+,KJs)
10. A7o at BB call BTN 3x open (At least use A8o), if 2.5x open, use A3o
11. KQs/KJs/QJs/AQo at UTG call SB/BB 3bet, (should call with AJs+)
12. AJo/KQo at CO call SB 3bet
13. KTs at BTN 3bet MP open (should 3bet KJs+)
14. SB vs BB facing 3bet, 55+, AJo+, ATs+, KJs, QJs should small 4bet. TT+, AK call off 5bet. 
15. SB vs BB, 22 should fold, 33/44 should limp/call
16. BTN vs SB, JJ/AKo should 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs are 4bet call
17. 3bet KJo at SB vs BTN (KJo is fold, AJo is 3bet)
18. AQo at BB not squeeze UTG open, BTN call (Playing AQo OOP is difficult multiple, even hitting TPTK on dry board you don't know if it's good facing aggression)
19. AQo at CO not 3bet MP open. 
20. BB 3bet SB, SB 4bet All in 100BB, BB should call QQ+/AK. 

## Flop

1. Weak A high without even backdoor equity, check call 1/3 - half pot bet
2. K high with backdoor equity check call 1/3 on A high board, or call 1/2 on paired board. 
3. Third pair check call 1/3 pot on A high flop. e.g. 77 on AT5.
4. AK high bet 1/2 pot on lower board (should just bet 1/4 - 1/3)
5. Strong top pair not check raise BB vs BTN
6. Weak top pair check raise BB vs SB
7. Call large bet to draw lower end straight. e.g 75 on 89T (shouldn't call even IP)
8. MP vs BTN, should cbet top two quite small on TJK (why?)
9. Not raise bottom set in 3bet pot on Jhigh flop (When raise, raise half pot, the goal is to get it in on the turn)
10. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with flush draw on paired board. e.g. Ts4s on 7s9h9s
11. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with gut shot on lower connected board. e.g. Qc7h on 8h9h5c
12. SB vs BB, cbet should be half pot, unless intentionally trying to induce bluff
13. SB vs BB, not cbet on board favours SB's range like 78 on KQ5. 
14. BB vs SB, when deep stacked, raise cbet on board that SB has a big nuts advantage (KKQ, or KQ8)
15. Call check raise with gut shot on flush draw board (e.g. QsTc on 5c7c9h)
16. 22 calls half pot cbet on 469r (even if a lower board, 22 should still be a fold)
17. QQ call 3bet IP, call 1/2 pot cbet on A high board (e.g. Ad9d2s, even as strong as QQ should be a fold)
18. BTN vs MP single raised pot, JJ call 60% pot cbet on A high board. (MP has a strong range, JJ should fold)
19. Multiway pot, cbet small with nutty hand (should always check raise, if flop check through, turn still check raise)
20. Multiway pot, check top pair on A high K high board. (KJ on KT5, AQ on A56 should bet 1/3, overpair on lower board should check)

## Turn

1. A high call large bet on double paired board
2. After check top set (QQ) on the flop, when turn is A, should 2x bet, targeting villain's top pair
3. After villain check raises on the flop, then check the turn, should either bet 1/4 - 1/3 or check. Don't bet 1/2 unless super strong hand. 
4. Villain min bet turn, then bet river usually has it. Cannot call with A high.
5. Call big bet OOP to draw nuts
6. Don't know how to play TT on QQ54 in 3bet pot OOP. (TT should be played no differently from KK/AA, if villan's got an Q, then let me win)
7. Bet small when turned flush in multiway pot. (Should check raise to build the pot)
8. Check nuts oop on the turn on super dry board, or super wet board (e.g KQ on QQ77, AsKh on QsJs9s5s, they should continue betting half pot to extract value)

## River

1. Fold pair on 4 flush board getting riduculous good odds
2. River not triple barrel on super scary card (Td4c6c2h3h)
3. Can't fold trip on flush board
4. Call with A high on the turn and on the river
5. 3bet pot, river value bet TPTK (AK) when back door flush completes. (Should only value bet 2pair+)
6. Overplay small full house (see villain has pot commited, shove small full house then run into bigger full house)
7. Rainbow dry board is good to triple barrel. From villain's perspective, there is not many busted draws
8. Sometimes bluff A high OOP to avoid getting bluffed. (e.g. Flop/Turn check, river holding AT on 56678)
9. SB vs BB, not value bet 2 pair when possible flush completes on river (e.g Kc8h on KhQs5s4h8s, should pot bet/fold)
10. Check call flop and river, then lead river on 4 card to a flush board (e.g. KsJh on 4s2sQsJsKh, should check call the river)
11. Afraid of bluffing the river when holding no showdown (e.g. 6s7s on Js4c2hKc3s, good candidates to triple barrel because it doesn't block flush draw, and it blocks nut straight, and it has no showdown value)
12. BB vs BTN, Top pair not value bet after villain cbet flop then checks back
13. Flop check through, turn bluff, then river completes back door flush is usually a good card to bluff.

Obeservation and thoughts:

1. When villain pot size bet on A high board, they usually have it
2. Bluff frequency increases on lower board. 
3. Villain check raises flop, when betting half pot, he is likely to have top pair or better. When betting 75% pot, he is likely to have draw. 
4. Bet/check/Bet is a strong line
5. Villains under bluff on double paired board because they assume hero will call with A high. 
6. Tank - large bet usually has the nuts
7. Since after villain check raises the flop on flush draw board, villain almost always follows through on the turn, there is no need to defend with bottom pair (because hero has to fold bottom pair facing aggression)
8. Sometimes when bet and check is close, prefer to bet to make life easier. 
9. Should very rarely flat with non pocket pair hand facing a 4x+ raise
