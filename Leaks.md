## Preflop

1. KQo at BTN/SB squeeze MP/CO open
2. KQo not 3bet BB vs SB
3. AJo/KQo at CO call or 4bet BTN's 3bet(They should all fold, even to a 3x 3bet, AQo/AQs/KQs/KJs/QJs call, TT/JJ/AKo 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs 4bet call)
4. 88/99 at SB squeeze MP/CO open (TT+ should squeeze)
5. TT/JJ cold 4bet MP open, BTN 3bet (TT should fold, JJ should call)
6. 89s, 55 call large 3bet (4x+ hero open)
7. AQo not cold 4bet BTN open, SB 3bet, (Should half pot cold 4bet) 
8. AQo call all in BB vs SB against 50BB short stacker
9. Use A5s-A9s to isolate limp fish (At least use AT+)
10. A7o at BB call BTN 3x open (At least use A8o), if 2.5x open, use A3o
11. KQs/KJs/QJs/AQo at UTG call SB/BB 3bet, (should call with AJs+)
12. AJo/KQo at CO call SB 3bet
13. KTs at BTN 3bet MP open (should 3bet KJs+)
14. SB vs BB facing 3bet, 55+, AJo+, ATs+, KJs, QJs should small 4bet. TT+, AK call off 5bet. 
15. SB vs BB, 22 should fold, 33/44 should limp/call
16. BTN vs SB, JJ/AKo should 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs are 4bet call
17. 3bet KJo at SB vs BTN (KJo is fold, AJo is 3bet)
18. AQo at BB not squeeze UTG open, BTN call (Playing AQo OOP is difficult multiple, even hitting TPTK on dry board you don't know if it's good facing aggression)
19. AQo at CO not 3bet MP open. 

## Flop

1. Weak A high without even backdoor equity, check call 1/3 - half pot bet
2. K high with backdoor equity check call 1/3 on A high board, or call 1/2 on paired board. 
3. Third pair check call 1/3 pot on A high flop. e.g. 77 on AT5.
4. AK high bet 1/2 pot on lower board (should just bet 1/4 - 1/3)
5. Strong top pair not check raise BB vs BTN
6. Weak top pair check raise BB vs SB
7. Call large bet to draw lower end straight. e.g 75 on 89T
8. MP vs BTN, should cbet top two quite small on TJK (why?)
9. Not raise bottom set in 3bet pot on Jhigh flop (When raise, raise half pot, the goal is to get it in on the turn)
10. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with flush draw on paired board. e.g. Ts4s on 7s9h9s
11. SB vs BB, cbet should be half pot
12. SB vs BB, not cbet on board favours SB's range like 78 on KQ5. 
13. BB vs SB, when deep stacked, raise cbet on board that SB has a big nuts advantage (KKQ, or KQ8)
14. Call check raise with gut shot on flush draw board (e.g. QsTc on 5c7c9h)

## Turn

1. A high call large bet on double paired board
2. After check top set (QQ) on the flop, when turn is A, should 2x bet, targeting villain's top pair
3. After villain check raises on the flop, then check the turn, should either bet 1/4 - 1/3 or check. Don't bet 1/2 unless super strong hand. 
4. Villain min bet turn, then bet river usually has it. Cannot call with A high.
5. Call big bet OOP to draw nuts
6. Don't know how to play TT on QQ54 in 3bet pot OOP. (TT should be played no differently from KK/AA, if villan's got an Q, then let me win)

## River

1. Fold pair on 4 card flush board getting riduculous good odds
2. River not triple barrel on super scary card (Td4c6c2h3h)
3. Can't fold trip on flush board
4. Call with A high on the turn and on the river
5. 3bet pot, river value bet TPTK (AK) when back door flush completes. (Should only value bet 2pair+)
6. Overplay small full house (see villain has pot commited, shove small full house then run into bigger full house)
7. Rainbow dry board is good to triple barrel. From villain's perspective, there is not many busted draws
8. Sometimes bluff A high OOP to avoid getting bluffed. (e.g. Flop/Turn check, river holding AT on 56678)
9. Generally speaking, very unsure when to bluff the river

Obeservation and thoughts:

1. When villain pot size bet on A high board, they usually have it
2. Bluff frequency increases on lower board. 
3. Villain check raises flop, when betting half pot, he is likely to have top pair or better. When betting 75% pot, he is likely to have draw. 
4. Bet/check/Bet is a strong line
5. Villains under bluff on double paired board because they assume hero will call with A high. 
6. Tank - large bet usually has the nuts
7. Since after villain check raises the flop on flush draw board, villain almost always follows through on the turn, there is no need to defend with bottom pair (because hero has to fold bottom pair facing aggression)
8. Sometimes when bet and check is close, prefer to bet to make life easier.
