## Preflop

1. KQo at BTN/SB squeeze MP/CO open
2. KQo not 3bet BB vs SB
3. AQo/AJo/KQo at CO call or 4bet BTN's 3bet(They should all fold, even to a 3x 3bet)
4. 88/99 at SB squeeze MP/CO open (TT+ should squeeze)
5. TT/JJ cold 4bet MP open, BTN 3bet
6. 89s, 55 call large 3bet (4x+ hero open)
7. AQo not cold 4bet BTN open, SB 3bet, (Should half pot cold 4bet) 
8. AQo call all in BB vs SB against 50BB short stacker
9. Use A5s-A9s to isolate limp fish (At least use AT+)
10. A7o at BB call BTN 3x open (At least use A8o), if 2.5x open, use A3o
11. KQs/KJs/QJs/AQo at UTG call SB/BB 3bet, (should call with AJs+)
12. AJo/KQo at CO call SB 3bet
13. KTs at BTN 3bet MP open (should 3bet KJs+)

## Flop

1. Weak A high without even backdoor equity check call 1/3 - half pot bet
2. Third pair check call 1/3 pot on A high flop. e.g. 77 on AT5.
3. AK high bet 1/2 pot on lower board (should just bet 1/4 - 1/3)
4. Strong top pair not check raise BB vs BTN
5. Weak top pair check raise BB vs SB
6. Call large bet to draw lower end straight. e.g 75 on 89T
7. MP vs BTN, should cbet top two quite small on TJK (why?)
8. Not raise bottom set in 3bet pot on Jhigh flop (When raise, raise half pot, the goal is to get it in on the turn)
9. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with flush draw on paired board. e.g. Ts4s on 7s9h9s
10. SB vs BB, cbet should be half pot
11. SB vs BB, not cbet on board favours SB's range like 78 on KQ5. 

## Turn

1. A high call large bet on double paired board
2. After check top set (QQ) on the flop, when turn is A, should 2x bet, targeting villain's top pair
3. After villain check raises on the flop, then check the turn, should either bet 1/4 - 1/3 or check. Don't bet 1/2 unless super strong hand. 
4. Villain min bet turn, then bet river usually has it. Cannot call with A high.
5. Call big bet OOP to draw nuts

## River

1. Fold pair on 4 card flush board getting riduculous good odds
2. River not triple barrel on super scary card (Td4c6c2h3h)
3. Can't fold trip on flush board
4. Call with A high on the turn and on the river
5. 3bet pot, river value bet TPTK (AK) when back door flush completes. (Should only value bet 2pair+)
6. Overplay small full house (see villain has pot commited, shove small full house then run into bigger full house)
7. Generally speaking, very unsure when to bluff the river

Obeservation:

1. When villain pot size bet on A high board, they usually have it
2. Bluff frequency increases on lower board. 
3. Villain checks raise flop, when betting half pot, he is likely to have top pair or better. When betting 75% pot, he is likely to have draw.
