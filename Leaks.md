## Tilt management

1. Take a break after losing a big pot
2. Keep asking myself "Am I playing my A game right now"?
3. Be aware that I can be frustrated at keeping losing small pots. 

## Turn decision processing after villain calls the flop

1. What's the stack pot ratio now? If less than 3, overpair should stack off. e.g. KK on TT55. 
2. If turn card completes potential flush or straight, bet half pot (bluff or value bet)
3. If board is dry without pair, overbet with semi bluff and two pair+. e.g. 55,JQ on AK56
4. If board is dry with top card paired, bet 1/4 pot
5. If board is dry with middle card paired on the turn, check back or pot?
6. If 4 card to a straight or 4 card to a flush, bet 1/4 pot. 

## Flop check raise sizing guideline

1. Never raise big on wet board even with the nuts, because the turn can change the board dramatically. If turn is a safe card, then fire big. 
2. Dry board should raise big over small bet, raise small over big bet. e.g. pot size raise 1/3 pot cbet, but min raise PSB cbet. 

## Preflop Leaks

1. ~~KQo at BTN/SB squeeze MP/CO open~~
2. ~~KQo not 3bet BB vs SB~~
3. ~~AJo/KQo at CO call or 4bet BTN's 3bet(They should all fold, even to a 3x 3bet, AQo/AQs/KQs/KJs/QJs call, TT/JJ/AKo 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs 4bet call)~~
4. ~~88/99 at SB squeeze MP/CO open (TT+ should squeeze)~~
5. 88/99 at BB not squeeze BTN open. (66+ should squeeze)
6. 88/99 at BB not squuze MP short stacker open.
7. ~~TT/JJ cold 4bet MP open, BTN 3bet (TT should fold, JJ should call)~~
8. 89s, 55 call large 3bet (4x+ hero open)
9. AQo not cold 4bet BTN open, SB 3bet, (Should half pot cold 4bet) 
10. ~~AQo call all in BB vs SB against 50BB short stacker~~
11. ~~Use A6s-A9s, TJ+ to isolate limp short stack fish (At least use AT+,KJs)~~
12. ~~Not use A5s+ to isolate limper big stack (Should use A2+,AT+,KJs+,KJo,TT+,etc to isolate big stack fish, TJs,55-99 is call)~~
13. ~~A7o at BB call BTN 3x open (At least use A8o), if 2.5x open, use A3o~~
14. ~~KQs/KJs/QJs/AQo at UTG call SB/BB 3bet, (should call with AJs+)~~
15. ~~AJo/KQo at CO call SB 3bet~~
16. ~~KTs at BTN 3bet MP open (should 3bet KJs+)~~
17. ~~SB vs BB facing 3bet, 55+, AJo+, ATs+, KJs, QJs should small 4bet. TT+, AK call off 5bet.~~
18. ~~SB vs BB, 22 should fold, 33/44 should limp/call~~
19. ~~BTN vs SB, JJ/AKo should 4bet fold, QQ+/AKs are 4bet call~~
20. ~~3bet KJo at SB vs BTN (KJo is fold, AJo is 3bet)~~
21. AQo at BB not squeeze UTG open, BTN call (Playing AQo OOP is difficult multiple, even hitting TPTK on dry board you don't know if it's good facing aggression)
22. ~~AQo at CO not 3bet MP open.~~
23. BB 3bet SB, SB 4bet All in 100BB, BB should call QQ+/AK. 
24. ~~AK/QQ not 4bet MP 3bet~~
25. MP open, Hero at BTN 3bet with AKs, SB small cold 4bet, Hero flats (Should 5 bet all in with AKs, but fold AKo, and flat QQ)
26. BB 3bet push 100BB, should hero at BTN call with JJ? (Yes, JJ is a call)
27. QTs at MP call BB 3bet (QJs is also a fold, should call with KJs)
28. Not knowing SB's 3 bet range is different between BTN open 3x or 2.5x. 
29. **AKs at SB/BB 5bet shove EP/MP big4 4bet, (EP/MP has a very strong range as they will call AK/QQ, AKo should fold, AKs should call)**

## Flop

1. ~~Weak A high without even backdoor equity, check call 1/3 - half pot bet~~
2. AT,A8 A high check call more than 1/2 pot stab, e.g. ATo on 749, A8 on 774.
3. 2nd pair call psb in multiway pot. e.g 77 on Q33. 
4. K high with backdoor equity check call 1/3 on A high board, or call 1/2 on paired board. 
5. Third pair check call 1/3 pot on A high flop. e.g. 77 on AT5.
6. ~~AK high bet 1/2 pot on lower board (should just bet 1/4 - 1/3)~~
7. ~~Strong top pair not check raise BB vs BTN~~
8. ~~Weak top pair check raise BB vs SB~~
9. Call large bet to draw lower end straight. e.g 75 on 89T (shouldn't call even IP)
10. MP vs BTN, should cbet top two quite small on TJK (because the board favours MP's range)
11. Not raise bottom set in 3bet pot on Jhigh flop (When raise, raise half pot, the goal is to get it in on the turn)
12. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with flush draw on paired board. e.g. Ts4s on 7s9h9s
13. BB vs SB, not raise cbet with gut shot on lower connected board. e.g. Qc7h on 8h9h5c
14. SB vs BB, cbet should be half pot, unless intentionally trying to induce bluff
15. SB vs BB, not cbet on board favours SB's range like 78 on KQ5. 
16. ~~BB vs SB, when deep stacked, raise cbet on board that SB has a big nuts advantage (KKQ, or KQ8)~~
17. Call check raise with gut shot on flush draw board (e.g. QsTc on 5c7c9h)
18. 22 calls half pot cbet on 469r (even if a lower board, 22 should still be a fold)
19. QQ call 3bet IP, call 1/2 pot cbet on A high board (e.g. Ad9d2s, even as strong as QQ should be a fold)
20. BTN vs MP single raised pot, JJ call 60% pot cbet on A high board. (MP has a strong range, JJ should fold)
21. Multiway pot, cbet small with nutty hand (should always check raise, if flop check through, turn still check raise)
22. ~~Multiway pot, check top pair on A high K high board. (KJ on KT5, AQ on A56 should bet 1/3, overpair on lower board should check)~~
23. QQ in 4bet pot check on JT8 flop because of fearing running into JJ/TT. (Should cbet 1/2 pot, and shove the turn. If running into JJ/TT so be it. Giving a free card and let villain catch up is a huge mistake)
24. BB vs SB, top pair good kicker not bet after SB check (e.g KT on K42, should half pot/call)
25. KQs call 1/2 pot cbet OOP in 3bet pot with only back door flush and two over. e.g KsQs on 5s5d4d (This hand should fold, the weakest hand to call is Ax with back door flush)
26. ~~Check raise top set. (Top set should always check call down, unless villain is pot committed)~~
27. CO vs BTN, JTo cbet Q54 flop (Q high flop favours BB flat range, should be a check fold)
28. A high cbet wet board (A3 cbet Jc9c5d)
29. A high call half pot bet on wet board (e.g AsKd on Tc8c6d)
30. QQ call half pot bet on A high board in multiway pot (e.g. QQ on AJ68)

## Turn

1. ~~A high call large bet on double paired board~~
2. After check top set (QQ) on the flop, when turn is A, should 2x bet, targeting villain's top pair
3. ~~After villain check raises on the flop, then check the turn, should either bet 1/4 - 1/3 or check. Don't bet 1/2 unless super strong hand. ~~
4. Villain min bet turn, then bet river usually has it. Cannot call with A high.
5. Call big bet OOP to draw nuts
6. Don't know how to play TT on QQ54 in 3bet pot OOP. (Should bet small/fold, river check/fold)
7. Bet small when turned flush in multiway pot. (Should check raise to build the pot)
8. Check nuts oop on the turn on super dry board, or super wet board (e.g KQ on QQ77, AsKh on QsJs9s5s, they should continue betting half pot to extract value)
9. SB vs BB, if having showdown value but cannot check call, use block bet. e.g AT on K982. If can check call, then check. e.g. A6 on QQ6K. 
10. Check back middle pair on 4 card to flush board (middle pair has no showdown value, should turn it into bluff)
11. Not realise weak A high on wet board has no show down value, e.g. A4 on J953. It's better to bet to generate fold equity. 
12. Check back board where top card pairs, e.g. TT65, or QQ45, should bet small
13. Check back 4 card to straight board, e.g. AA on 5678, should bet small and fold to a raise. 

## River

1. Fold pair on 4 flush board getting riduculous good odds
2. River not triple barrel on super scary card (Td4c6c2h3h)
3. Can't fold trip on flush board
4. ~~Call with A high on the turn and on the river~~
5. 3bet pot, river value bet TPTK (AK) when back door flush completes. (Should only value bet 2pair+)
6. Overplay small full house (see villain has pot commited, shove small full house then run into bigger full house)
7. Rainbow dry board is good to triple barrel. From villain's perspective, there is not many busted draws
8. Sometimes bluff A high OOP to avoid getting bluffed. (e.g. Flop/Turn check, river holding AT on 56678)
9. SB vs BB, not value bet 2 pair when possible flush completes on river (e.g Kc8h on KhQs5s4h8s, should pot bet/fold)
10. Check call flop and turn, then lead river on 4 card to a flush board (e.g. KsJh on 4s2sQsJsKh, should check call the river)
11. Afraid of bluffing the river when holding no showdown (e.g. 6s7s on Js4c2hKc3s, good candidates to triple barrel because it doesn't block flush draw, and it blocks nut straight, and it has no showdown value)
12. BB vs BTN, Top pair not value bet on the river after villain cbet flop then checks back
13. Flop check through, turn bluff, then river completes back door flush is usually a good card to bluff.
14. Feel uncomfortable calling overbet with just one pair
15. On 4 card to straight board (e.g. 789JA), OOP can bet small with merged range, but IP should always polar targeting villain's two pair, and can be balanced with lots of bluffs. Betting small IP makes no sense, very hard to balance with bluffs)
16. ~~SB vs BB, river check the nuts after cbet flop and turn. (Must check with a very good reason, if cannot find the reason then keep betting) ~~
17. Small pair cbet small on mono flop, check back turn, river completes 4 card flush, villain checks, it's a good chance to turn small pair into bluff. Bet 1/3. (e.g. 55 on AsKs7s4d8s)
18. **Afraid of calling down with top pair weak kicker. e.g. UTG vs BTN, A9 check call, check call, check fold on A338K**
19. **Over call in 3 street hand, e.g. A5 call down on A5QT3, or AK call down on AQ57J**
20. **Over fold in 2 street hand (flop or turn checks through, e.g. KQ fold on K647J, A5 fold on T5776)**
21. **Over call check raise in multiway pot after flop and turn checks through. e.g A9 on AT5Q4**
22. Middle pair small block bet in 3bet pot after turn checks through
23. **Must resist the urge to block bet OOP.**

## Obeservation and thoughts:

1. When villain pot size bet on A high board, they usually have it
2. Bluff frequency increases on lower board. 
3. Villain check raises flop, when betting half pot, he is likely to have top pair or better. When betting 75% pot, he is likely to have draw. 
4. Bet/check/Bet is a strong line
5. Villains under bluff on double paired board because they assume hero will call with A high. 
6. Tank - large bet usually has the nuts
7. Since after villain check raises the flop on flush draw board, villain almost always follows through on the turn, there is no need to defend with bottom pair (because hero has to fold bottom pair facing aggression)
8. Sometimes when bet and check is close, prefer to bet to make life easier. 
9. Should very rarely flat with non pocket pair hand facing a 4x+ raise
10. Half pot bet gets no respect, so on the turn nutty hands should only bet half pot. Top two is a very candidate because it blocks villain's calling range, but unblocks villain's bluff range. 
11. Short stacker is more likely to bluff raise
12. Villain over check/raise flop, and almost always fires the turn. This means hero can over fold the flop, and select strong combo that can call a large turn bet.
13. Try best to gain the initiative, use 10% to block bet on the turn with 2nd pair
14. Pot size cbet works well because villain doesn't face it everyday and generally will over fold. 
15. When deciding whether to call a bet on the turn, need to not only think about the real outs, but also the bluff outs, such as front door flush draw. 
16. When check raise with set on the flop, the size should always be large (unless in multiway pot), because villain tends to call the flop raise then fold to turn aggression. So the most profitible line is pot size raise, then half pot, half pot. 
17. Dry board: bet small, bet big, bet bigger. Wet board: bet large, bet small (1/2 pot), bet small (1/2 pot) (given the board texture doesn't change). Reason: Villains don't fold pair on the flop even if it's wet, and villains also don't like to fold pair when all the draws brick off. However, if on the turn the board is wet, and villain only has middle pair, he's likely to fold to big bet. Hence the small bet to put villain in an indifferent position. 
18. Villain tends to under bluff high card board (A,K,Q high, or AKx, KQx), so when facing a PSB on this type of board, middle pair is unlikely to be good. 
19. SB vs BB, turn should check raise nuts, especially when board favours villain's range (e.g. 89 on 5673)
20. Overbet nut straight, but half pot full house that blocks top pair 
21. Called too much when "I know I am beat, but I can't fold". 
22. After losing a buy in or more, I find myself unable to make the fold I am supposed to make. 
23. When there is three broad way cards, facing river psb, one pair is never good. Only top two plus should consider calling. 
24. After check raise the turn, even not holding the nuts, still should bet large to balance the bluffs. Don't hope villain to bluff or thin value bet. 
25. Need to respect the pot size bet from a strong range. 
26. Don't over play set. e.g overbet or big check raise on the board where there is straight possibility. 
27. A2-A9 has little showdown value even on dry board, when there is a draw should still barrel. 
28. Turn small, river big is usually bluff on lower board. 
29. **The drier the board, the bigger the raise. e.g. raise 2x on A95r with gutshot or set, but 0.5x on QcJc8d with QJ or flush draw, even the nuts. Because the board can change dramatically on the turn, we want to give ourselves room to fold.**
30. Should always keep in mind that villain has small pocket pairs in his range if flop small bet call or checks through. 
31. **When SPR is less than 3, never fold overpair**
32. **Some villains like to bluff raise over 60%-75% pot bet, repping backdoor flush etc**
33. When villain gives up betting initiatives, hero should stab A/K/Q high board with at least half pot intending to fold out middle pair. Betting 1/4 -1/3 pot achieves nothing. 

## Snowie profitable line

1. EP middle set profitable line: check/call, check/raise, pot. 
2. 3 bet pot flop Top two pot size bet, half pot improving to full house, river all in. 
3. Straight overbet the turn to target two pair
4. BB overbet trip on the turn after flop checks through
5. BB flops flush, flop check through, turn should check again.
6. Top pair plus draw bet big (A9 on A678 after flop checks through)
7. Turn bet pot on relatively wet board with top pair even weak kicker, check back river
8. IP always bet set big, even top set, at least pot, or even 2*pot. 
9. BB vs SB, SB check, BB bets small, check two pair on the turn (where straight is possible), pot river. 
10. 4bet 88 OOP, check middle set on K high board 3 times. 
11. Turn bet small to draw flush, when flush completes on paired board check call large bet, check raise small bet. 
12. Play nut straight as if it's nuts on flush board. 
13. 3bet BTN vs MP, KK cbet pot on 333 flop. 
14. BTN vs BB, Q2Q46, cbet 1/4, turn 1/4, river pot as bluff. 
15. 3bet top set on dry board IP. BB vs SB, 3bet bottom two. 

## BTN vs BB, flop check through, BB turn stab

Never 2x when there is front flush draw, because it's too obvious. 

1. No straight or flush possible, two pair+ 2x overbet e.g. A3 on AJ63. All other check. 
3. One straight is possible, straight 2x overbet. Other check 50% raise. 
4. Flush is possible. Nut flush, Good flush draw 2x overbet. Two pair+ check min raise. 
5. Low card any trip with no flush possible, 2x overbet e.g. 56 on 66A7
6. High card middle trip where villain can have full house, psb e.g. JT on QTT6
7. High card top trip, check min raise, e.g. QT on QQ29
8. Full house, check call

## River call or fold decision should consider factors

1. Villain has a tight range or wide range to begin with? Villain at BB in a single raised pot certainly has a wider range than a UTG 4bet range.
2. Has any street checked through? If yes, villain has a wider range than both flop and turn having action. 
3. If villain check call the flop, is the bet small or large? Villain still has a wide range if the bet is small. 
4. Is the board A/K high? Villain underbluffs on A/K high board, but overbluffs on lower board. 
5. Is the board very wet, lots of straigh or flush possible? If yes, second pair usualy is not good.
6. Is it a multiway pot? If yes, villain has a lower bluff frequency than heads up. second pair is usually no good to call. 

## When to 2x the river OOP (Villain bets the flop then checks back the turn)

1. When river is a A or K
